<p>Hello There!</p>

<p>You have received this message because the last run of the scheduleContactCompletionEffort ran enough times for this week.</p>
<p>In addition, the reset job completed successfully.</p>

<p>You may want to run the Completeness Report to get a measure of how much effort the users are putting into completing their data.</p>

Thank you,<br>
