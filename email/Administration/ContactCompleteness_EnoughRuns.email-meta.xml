    <textOnly>Hello There!

You have received this message because the last run of the scheduleContactCompletionEffort ran enough times for this week.

In addition, the reset job completed successfully.

You may want to run the Completeness Report to get a measure of how much effort the users are putting into completing their data.

Thank you,
The CareFirst SFDC Development Team</textOnly>
